The following is the work of HersheyCactus

AP Computer Science A

All files found in the "proj" directory are my final project files. These are
what are used to run the program.

All extra files found in the directory "misc" were either used as
reference for my final project, or were earlier versions of my project.

Files used to help me create my project are labeled as such in the top
few lines with:
//This is an imported file from Oracle's Java Tutorials archive.
//None of the following is my work.

Files I created myself that are no longer in use for the project, but are
still useful to see are labeled as such in the top few lines with:
// [One or two lines describing the file's previous use]
// This object is not used in the final project, and as such, complete documentation
// has not been created.

All extra files found in the "images" directory were downloaded from the Java
example programs zip and are not used in my final project. They are included
in the case that ButtonDemo.java is tested, and otherwise can be ignored.

-

All extra files found in the "doc" directory are used to access the finished
Javadoc documentation. All such files are included.
Within this directory, the "proj" directory can be accessed to find the
class-specific Javadoc files.
