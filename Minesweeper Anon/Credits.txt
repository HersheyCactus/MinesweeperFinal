The following is the work of HersheyCactus
2020
AP Computer Science A

The files found in this zip also contain all of the sources I used
in this project, not counting some select StackOverflow questions
I used as reference for certain sections of the program.

Examples of areas where I used StackOverflow as a reference may be
evident in the program being less efficient. Such areas would be:
- Changing the text color
- Changing the text size
- Changing button color
- Usage of the Box object

Other areas where I may have used code created by others are clearly
outlined in the Javadoc Documentation.
